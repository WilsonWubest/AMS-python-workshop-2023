Meteorologists routinely use [radiosondes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosonde) attached to weather balloons for assimilation in weather models and to monitor for severe weather. Satellite sounding products like NUCAPS can measure temperature and moisture at about a 1km vertical resolution, but not winds.
